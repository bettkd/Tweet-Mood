To Whom It May Concern:

I am pleased to write this recommendation on behalf of Mr. John Smith. Mr. Smith began working for GoodWell Textile Co., Ltd. in February of 2009. As the sales manager of this company, I have seen Mr. Smith work studiously and with intelligence. He has established good relationships with his colleagues, and during his time in this company he has developed strong leadership and interpersonal skills that have been unanimously praised by colleagues.

Mr. Smith joined the company after he finished his undergraduate studies. He worked very hard and progressed steadily, revealing his passion and enthusiasm for international trade in the process. His duties involved recruiting new customers and retaining existing customers, as well as managing customers' orders.

Mr. Smith's talents were always evident in his performance. He displayed strong leadership abilities, logical thinking abilities, and the ability to work well with teams. He consistently completed tasks assigned by the leadership on time and without errors. In short, he was a model member of our company. As a result of his impressive performance, Mr. Smith was promoted after two years to the position of Assistant Manager of the Sales Department.

His performance at work proves that he is fully capable of fulfilling the MBA course at your institution. His excellent English ability has been affirmed repeatedly by our customers, and this has proven an asset to our company. I am confident that Mr. Smith will make a positive addition to your school, and the opportunity to study in your school will allow him to better develop his career plans and solidify his potential.

I therefore offer my recommendation of Mr. John Smith without reservation. If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.
