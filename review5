Waldo Emerson Inn Bed & Breakfast in Kennebunk, Maine
The wife of a B&B owner in Kennebunk, Maine seems to be trying to sabotage the operation. While the male innkeeper offered stories of the inn’s history on the Underground Railroad, his wife offered charred slice-and-bake cookies. The inn’s namesake dog also did his part to make the place homey. “They had a new adorable black poodle, Waldo, who left us little smelly packages outside our bedroom door!!” writes user Leslieannadams at Trip Advisor. “Now this would have been funny, because I am a big dog lover, but after all, we were paying for this. When we told the innkeeper the response was, ‘Oh, bad little puppy.’ No ‘I’m sorry’ or anything!”
And when it was time to go: “She LITERALLY—and I mean literally—pushed us out the front door. As soon as we paid she physically began nudging us with her body toward the front door and said, ‘You’ve got to go. Go! Go! We have work to do! Leave now!’ We were literally stumbling backwards trying to get out as quickly as she wanted us to. It was almost comical, but not quite.”
