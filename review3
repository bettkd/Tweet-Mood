3) “Smelly, Hot, Shabby & Dirty-Otherwise OK”
Galt House Hotel & Suites in Louisville, Kentucky
“To call this a ‘fleabag’ hotel would be an unconscionable insult to both fleas and bags everywhere,” writes TripAdvisor user BruceLafleur. “In my 25 years of business travel, I have never experienced such a consistently, depressingly mediocre property.”
An employee advised user Firemedic599 to trek up two escalators and across a covered walkway to the other tower, where he was told that he needed go back down two escalators to the first floor. “SHE COULD HAVE TOLD ME TO JUST WALK ACROSS THE STREET—IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FASTER SINCE WE HAD LUGGAGE!!!” he writes. His room “smelled like burnt rubber and a doctor’s office.” It was so cheap that “the only thing missing was a quarter slot and vibrating bed.”
However, other TripAdvisor users rated Galt House favorably, even giving it multiple stars.
