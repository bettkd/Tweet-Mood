Dear Sir / Madam:

It is my great pleasure to write this letter in support of Miss Jane Smith’s application to your esteemed university.

I instructed Miss Smith for the course Introduction to the Tourism Industry. She was unquestionably one of the most able students in the class, and her work in the class consistently reflected a level of insightfulness and attention to detail that is unique to Miss Smith. Her reports were always prepared on time, and she stood out among her peers for her eagerness to engage in the process of learning and discovery. Simply put, Miss Smith was a true pleasure to have in class.

Miss Smith was happy to voice her own viewpoints during class discussions, and often asked me for further clarification of points I covered in my lecture. In addition to her confidence and eagerness to learn, Miss Smith also made a good impression on me due to her pleasant personality. Certainly, she seemed to get on well with classmates and teachers at all times, and I imagine that she will do the same when she is in your institution.

Based on my observation of her abilities, I strongly believe she has the potential to be an outstanding student at your university. I therefore recommend her for admission to your master’s program. Please do not hesitate to contact me for more information.

Yours sincerely,

Linda Johnson
Director
Department of Tourism
