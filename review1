1) “Yours Is A Very Bad Hotel”
The DoubleTree Club in Houston, Texas
Tom Farmer and Shane Atchison of Seattle made a PowerPoint presentation after their experience at DoubleTree Club of Houston, Texas to fully express the customer service nightmare. A night clerk named Mike was the subject of their wrath. “We held guaranteed, confirmed reservations at the DoubleTree Club for the night of November 14-15,” they wrote. “These rooms were held for late arrival with a major credit card. Tom is a card-carrying Hilton Honors Gold VIP. Yet when we arrived at 2:00am, we were refused rooms!”
The PowerPoint presentation has traveled far and wide enough to merit its own page on urban legends site Snopes.com. In recent interviews, Farmer and Atchison have begged for the 2001 presentation to be laid to rest: “We are beginning to think even Night Clerk Mike and his bosses may have suffered enough.”
