Ramada Inn and Convention Center in Aberdeen, South Dakota
The Ramada Inn and Convention Center in Aberdeen, South Dakota, seems to serve a niche market. “We stay here each year as pheasant hunters because we can eat, sleep, drink, and get our birds cleaned and frozen all in one location,” writes Priceline.com user George from Sissonville, West Virginia.
But user Greg from Brookings, South Dakota was unhappy with his stay. “I would not tell anyone to stay here. Old and staff did not know what they were doing. Could not even help us find our rooms. We had 5 couple with us, and we were all very unhappy with our stay. Rooms were dirty and smelled bad.” There couldn’t be any relationship between butchering pheasants and bad smells, could there?
However, the Priceline.com page says that the Inn has been recently remodeled (no date is given), so perhaps any unpleasant pheasant smell is gone.
