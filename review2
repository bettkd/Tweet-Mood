2) “Bathroom ceiling was leaking massive urine”
Plaza Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada
One Vegas hotel served TripAdvisor user MadamZCalifornia a horrifying cocktail for New Year’s Eve—urine, water and electricity. She met with a terrible stench after checking in. “The room smelled horrible. We were gagging. It smelled like sour milk and feet mixed.”
At first she tried to cover the problem. “We walked to Walgreens and ABC Store to get three bottles of air freshener. The lady who worked at ABC said that a lot of people who stayed at the Plaza came there to buy air fresheners!”

But soon the problem was traced to a streaming light fixture in the bathroom. “The bathroom light was filled with water and the light was blinking. It felt so dangerous with the water and electricity. I didn’t DARE try to turn the light off. We were traumatized…We were FREAKED OUT.” MadamZ says that her group had nowhere else to go since the city was booked solid for New Year’s Eve. After much hassle and arguing with the management, they were upgraded to a room with no smells or leakage, but MadamZ vows never to return.
